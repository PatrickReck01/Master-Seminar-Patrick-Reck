### Title: 
Evaluation and Improvement of Information Retrieval Capabilities of Edge Device LLMs

### Abstract:
While large language models are great tools for automatic summary creation, they can make mistakes and include hallucinations, reducing trust in their answers and limiting their deployment. Existing metrics to evaluate the quality of a summary have notable limitations, reducing their effectiveness in identifying misleading summaries. In this report, two new metrics are presented using edge-device-friendly large language models for summary evaluation, specifically with the goal of summarizing scientific biomedical literature. The KG-Score utilizes the concept of knowledge graphs to determine the quality of a summary, while the Bio-QAG-Score utilizes question-answer generation to detect inaccurate summaries. Both metrics have been evaluated on the SummEval dataset as well as a synthetic dataset. While both metrics show adequate performance on the SummEval dataset, they are outperforming existing benchmark metrics on the synthetic dataset, showcasing their potential for further development.
